## Red, Green, Refactor

Time to contribute!

Start with something that does not work, sub optimal.

Make it work.

Optimize it (make it precise, document) and hop to the next feature. Ideas are not fully formed
just start!


1. Make any changes while on your branch then push to GitHub
2. Open a Pull request to merge your changes to the dev-branch
3. That's it!

**Do's**
Try your best to explain what changes you made in the commit message. Here is a guide.

 - feat: A new feature
 - fix: A bug fix
 - docs: Documentation only changes
 - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
 - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
 - perf: A code change that improves performance
 - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
 - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
 - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
 - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
 - revert: Reverts a previous commit

----
Pull requests too should be a little detailed to ease the documentation. Just try!


**Donts!**

Never merge to the main branch.
